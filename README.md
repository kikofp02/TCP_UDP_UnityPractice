# Network Unity Lab2 - Implementation of a Game Loby with TCP UDP Connections

The project has evolved from the rough implementation of 2 separated scenes for the host and the clients. Now there is only one aplication that can achieve all the different posibilities. Also, on the game there is only one Console remaining, the Loby Manager, where the player can dp all the interactions.
- Interactions:
  - UDP/TCP Connection type, selected on the ui previous to setting the action (join/host)
  - Username setup, as the first action to perform
  - LobyName setup, previous to Hosting
  - Loby chat system with several online users
  - Disconnection from loby

 Achieved both UDP/TCP connection types for client and host, several connections for both methods and Users tracking.
